# Xibo Translations
Translations are managed in [Launchpad](https://translations.launchpad.net/xibo) and will updated to this folder before each release.

# Translators
We greatly appreciate any translation contributions. There are two options.

## Translating Online
Translations can be done using the Launchpad Web User Interface.

## Translating Offline
 1. Request a download of the language translation you are interested in doing from Launchpad.
 2. Download it when you receive the email
 3. Download and Install [PoEdit](http://poedit.net/)
 4. Open the PO file you downloaded in POEdit
 5. Make the translations
 6. Upload the file to Launchpad (making sure you are on the same language translation page)
 
Alternatively get the PO files from the translation export branch: 

```bash
bzr pull lp:~dangarner/xibo/swift-translations
```
