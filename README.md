# Installation

Installing an official release is [described in the manual](http://xibo.org.uk/manual/en/install_cms.html) and in the release notes of each release.



# Developing

**Please only install a Development environment if you intend make code changes to Xibo. Installing from the repository is not suitable for a production installation.**

Xibo uses Docker to ensure all contributors have a repeatable development environment which is easy to get up and running.

The very same Docker containers are used in our recommended end user installation to promote consistency from development to deployment.

To these ends this repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to spin up a model development environment.



## Prerequisites

The development Docker containers do not automatically build vendor files for PHP or JS, this is left as a developer responsibility. Therefore you will need the following tools:

 - Git
 - [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
 - NPM (coming in 2.0)
 - Docker





## Clone the repository

Create a folder in your development workspace and clone the repository. If you intend to make changes and submit pull requests please Fork us first and create a new branch.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your_id>/xibo-cms.git xibo-cms
```



## Install dependencies

Change into your new folder

```sh
cd xibo-cms
```

We recommend installing the dependencies via Docker, so that you are guarenteed consistent dependencies across different development machines.

### PHP dependencies

```bash
docker run --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/app --volume ~/.composer:/tmp composer install
```

This command also mounts the Composer `/tmp` folder into your home directory so that you can take advantage of Composer caching.

### Website dependencies (webpack)

```bash
docker run -it --volume $PWD:/app --volume ~/.npm:/root/.npm -w /app node:12 sh -c "npm install webpack -g; npm install; npm run build;"
```

### Mapped Volumes

The development version of Xibo expects the code base to be mapped into the container such that changes on the host
are reflected in the container.

However, the container itself creates some files, such as the twig cache and library uploads. These locations will need
to be created and the container given access to them.

The easiest way to do this is to make the `cache` and `library` folders and `chmod 777` them. Obviously this is not
suitable for production, but you shouldn't be using these files for production (we have containers for that).

### API Keys
The API requires a pub/private RSA keypair and an encryption key to be provided. The docker entrypoint will create 
these in `/library/certs`.

You can override the generated keys paths and encryption key by providing an alternative in `settings-custom.php`.
For example: 

```php
$apiKeyPaths = [
    'publicKeyPath' => '/var/www/cms/custom/public.key',
    'privateKeyPath' => '/var/www/cms/custom/private.key',
    'encryptionKey' => ''
];
```

### OpenOOH specification
Xibo can present the OpenOOH venue classifications in the display edit form. For this functionality to work in 
development, it is necessary 
to [download the latest file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openooh/venue-taxonomy/main/specification.json) and 
place it in here: `openooh/specification.json`

The production/CI containers add this file during the build process so that it is already available in the Docker
image.


## Bring up the Containers

Use Docker Compose to bring up the containers.

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Login
After the containers have come up you should be able to login with the details:

U: `xibo_admin`
P: `password`


## Translations
To parse the translations:

```bash
docker-compose exec web sh -c "cd /var/www/cms; rm -R ./cache"
docker-compose exec web sh -c "cd /var/www/cms; php bin/locale.php"
```

```bash
find ./locale ./cache ./lib ./web  -iname "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -k_e -k_x -k__ -o locale/default.pot
```

To import translations:

```bash
bzr pull lp:~dangarner/xibo/holmes-translations
```

Convert to `mo` format:

```bash
for i in *.po; do msgfmt "$i" -o $(echo $i | sed s/po/mo/); done
```

Move the resulting `mo` files into your `locale` folder.

## Swagger API Docs
To generate a `swagger.json` file, with the dev containers running:

```bash
docker-compose exec web sh -c "cd /var/www/cms; vendor/bin/swagger lib -o web/swagger.json"
```
